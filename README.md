# SECI1113 - Computational Mathematics

  In Assignment 3, we explored various numerical methods for finding iterations, including the bisection method, the secant method, and Newton's method. These techniques are fundamental for solving equations and optimizing functions in computational mathematics.

  In Assignment 4, we delved into a broader range of numerical and interpolation methods. We learned how to determine characteristic polynomials and find the dominant eigenvalue and smallest eigenvalue using the shifted power method. Additionally, we covered Newton and Lagrange interpolation techniques, least squares approximation, and methods for numerical differentiation such as the five-point central and three-point central differences. For numerical integration, we studied the trapezoidal method, Simpson's 1/3 method, Simpson's 3/8 rule, and Romberg integration, providing a comprehensive understanding of various approaches to solve complex mathematical problems.
